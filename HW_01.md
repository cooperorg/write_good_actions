One way to decrease approximation error is to continue expanding the Taylor series. Consider the function f(x)

    $f(x)=e^x = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}+...$

    We can approximate $e^x$ as $1+x$ (first order), $1+x+x^2/2$ (second order), and so on each higher order results in smaller error. 
    
    a. Use the given `exptaylor` function to approximate the value of exp(1) with a second-order Taylor series expansion. What is the relative error compared to `np.exp(1)`?
    
    b. Time the solution for a second-order Taylor series and a tenth-order Taylor series. How long would a 100,000-order series take (approximate this, you don't have to run it)
    
    c. Plot the relative error as a function of the Taylor series expansion order from first order upwards. (Hint: use method (4) in the comparison methods from the "Truncation and roundoff error accumulation in log-log plot" figure)

```{code-cell} ipython3
from math import factorial
def exptaylor(x,n):
    '''Taylor series expansion about x=0 for the function e^x
    the full expansion follows the function
    e^x = 1+ x + x**2/2! + x**3/3! + x**4/4! + x**5/5! +...'''
    if n<1:
        print('lowest order expansion is 0 where e^x = 1')
        return 1
    else:
        ex = 1+x # define the first-order taylor series result
        for i in range(1,n):
            ex+=x**(i+1)/factorial(i+1) # add the nth-order result for each step in loop
        return ex
        
```
